      <h2>What is Shopify and Dropshipping?</h2>
      <p>
        Shopify is one of the best platforms for dropshipping, dropshipping is
        basically where a seller sells products they don't have but by agreement
        to a manufacturer who does and provides the product to the customer who
        purchases their product, the seller serves as a store manager and
        advertiser for the manufacturer
      </p>
      <h2>Why Use Shopify?</h2>
      <p>
        dropshipping is a great opportunity to earn money if done well, the
        market for dropshipping is $470.92 billion in 2025 and is predicted to
        be $1,253.79 billion by 2030, the idea is that with Shopify you can
        easily setup an online store then just leave it there generating income
        because shopify handles a lot, but you can use shopify for free to see
        how it works and how you would dropship and calculate if it is the best
        move for you first without paying anything but theres so much
        competition, which makes it hard to earn, so I recommend using a course
        that'll guide you to do dropshipping well first, having a course and
        commitment to it will give you a high likelihood of success and the
        payout is huge if successful, here is a link to a good course on
