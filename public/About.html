    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>This is an affiliate marketing website designed to offer one of the best products in a category
    </p>

    <div style="display: block; width: 1px; height: 1px;"> </div>

    <h2>My Goal</h2>
    <p>Many blogs focus little on 'how can I increase the value of the reader' and more on 'how can I get more clicks',
        so they use
        marketing
        techniques that reduce value and increase clicks, like clickbait, loud ads, overstating the pros and
        understating the cons of what they advertise, etc. So I built this website with a focus on giving more value per
        time spent, I will still use techniques that grow the site but not ones which
        reduce your value, and due to my focus, you'll find concise blogs about high-quality products, since I do the researcch of what's a great product, you can read on the products I have written blogs on for reasons to go to them over other products rather than searching on your own, find out the quality for yourself by reading any blog here.</p>

    <div style="display: block; width: 1px; height: 1px;"> </div>

    <h2>Why My Blogs</h2>
    <textbox style="background-color: #4489be48;">
        <p style="text-align: middle; color: #d0e9ff;">
            <b>Efficiency</b><br> I write in a concise way and blogs are filtered by your preferences.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: middle; color: #ccffe5;">
            <b>Focus</b><br>The website is designed with the goal I mentioned above, the choice of words, style,
            features, everything.

    <!-- <h2>More Info On My Blogs</h2>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Product Blogs</h3>
    <p>I try to hide blogs you wouldn't want, for example, on social media I
        say
        the circumstances the product could be used for as the first few lines of text, this is a small change that
        greatly reduces clicks from people who wouldn't want the product
        and whenever you find a blog
        that
        could benefit you, it uses logic more to convince you, not marketing words,
        so you can verify if it's useful from your mind, since its concise it should take about 2 minutes to read,
        unless your interested.</p>

    <div style="display: block; width: 1px; height: 10px;"> </div>

    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Improvement Blogs</h3>
    <p>I have been exploring advanced self-development techniques rarely found in YouTube's self-development
        videos for over a year, the blogs speak for themselves, but what's important is action with said information,
        otherwise its worthless, so I
        made
        blogs that focus on sparking action too, other techniques you can find easily on
        YouTube,
        search for 'best
        sleeping habits' and you'll find many great habits from Doctors, CEOs, people using research, etc. So whether
        you use this site or not I reccomend exploring that area.</p>

    <div style="display: block; width: 1px; height: 10px;"> </div>

    <h3 style="text-align: center;">Spiritual Blogs</h3>
    <p>For something like spirituality, I think only the information should speak for itself, not the author, as no one
        in this world knows the full truth of life, so please dont think anything of me to
        unbiasly
        see my content and validate it only from your mind<!-- , also if your religious,
        see <a href="About.html"><u>this blog</u></a> first-->.</p> -->
